## 1. Vision  
To positively impact healthcare by using AI, a revolutionary technology to democratize access to diagnostic healthcare.

## 2. Structure
Neural Labs Africa is founded by two passionate Machine Learning Engineers towards solving Africa's most pressing challenges using technology.

## 3. The Problem
In Africa, healthcare services are overused yet under-resourced challenging healthcare
providers with a significant burden to diseases. A patient’s wait time to receive analyzed lab
results is often more than 2 weeks. This has resulted in late treatment reducing the chances of
survival especially with fast killing diseases such as Tuberculosis, Pneumonia and COVID-19.

## 4. Value Proposition
Using Deep Learning and Computer Vision our technology screens x-rays for radiologists and
hospitals in real time to identify over 13 respiratory diseases such as Pneumonia, TB, and lung
cancer. Now, instead of waiting for two weeks, we empower doctors to provide accurate diagnoses
before patients even get their shirts back on.

## 5. Project Scope
Neural Labs Africa is carrying out its operations in West Africa focusing on Francophone Africa.
Such plans to upscale our technology in different African regions is fostered by our vision to
build a solution for Africa, a region where diseases are overwhelming its population. Using our
current MVP to run clinical trials of our Software where we are engaging end-users to provide
tailor made predictive models within the diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, Neural
Labs Africa is focusing on strategic partnerships with hospitals, Tele-Radiology Laboratories,
and specialists to help impact and improve healthcare delivery within the different institutions.

## 6. Project Risks
Access to Data is among the most pressing challenges we are facing. This is because different
countries have different data regulations. For example, in Kenya Data collected within the
Kenyan demographic region should be stored within the Kenyan Demographic region as a result
most hospitals and institutions prefer to keep their data offline to meet these thresholds hence
such data is not accessible on cloud.

## 7. Values and Principles
The solutions that Neural Labs Africa creates for clients are only as excellent as the people who
create them. Neural Labs Africa conducts cultural experiments and actively involves its staff in
evolving the company's culture. The culture essentially combines agile administration,
independence, self-governance, routine evaluations, and participation monitoring.
This strategy has influenced mentoring and growth in the future. The transparency of Neural
Labs Africa is something we take great delight in. The company has shared the project repository
on open source platforms for the open source.

## 8. Contribution Policy
You are welcome to submit an update in the repo NeuralSight frontend if you do have any ideas that could enhance NeuralSight.
If you have any code that enhances a component of NeuralSight or implements new features, please submit a pull request to the associated repository. If those portions of code are tested and documented, it is more than welcome.

## 9. Contributor GuideLines
This guide explains how to contribute to the NeuralSight project. It defines working practices of the development team. This document helps new contributors start working on the project. It is a living document and will change. If you think something could be better, please open an issue with your feedback.

### Set up a development environment
Contents:
* Requirements
* Open Pull Request
* Discord
* Maintainer Response Time

### Requirements 
To setup NeuralSight development environment, you need the following:
* Python3 installed
* Discord Account


### Open a pull request
These guidelines help maintainers review new pull requests. Stick to the guidelines for quicker and easier pull request reviews.
>>
We prefer gradual, small changes over sudden, big changes
Write a helpful title for your pull request (if someone reads only one sentence, will they understand your change?)
Address the following questions in your pull request:
* What is a short summary of your change?
* Why is this change helpful?
* Any specific details to consider?
* What is the desired outcome of your change?

### Join Our Discord Channel
To better engahge with the development team, we would recommend you to sign up on Discord if you do yet have an account, then join our channel [Neural Labs Africa Discord channel](https://discord.gg/gAUMtT8p).

### Maintainer response time
Project maintainers make a best effort to respond in 10 days or less to new issues. Current maintainers are volunteers working on the project, so we try to keep up as best we can. If more than 10 days passed and you have not received a reply, follow up on [Neural Labs Africa Discord channel](https://discord.gg/gAUMtT8p). Someone may have missed your comment – we are not intentionally ignoring anyone.

Remember, using issue templates and answering the above questions in new pull requests reduces the response time from a maintainer to your issue or pull request.

## 10. Code of Conduct
This project adheres to a Code of Conduct based on Python. As a community member you have to read and agree with it.
